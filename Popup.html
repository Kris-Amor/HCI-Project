      <h2>Greetings!</h2>
      <p>Your new task is to sort out some waste as they move through the conveyor belt!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Green bins are for biodegradable materials / residual</li> 
        <li>Yellow bins are for non-biodegradable materials / recycle</li> 
        <li>Red bins are for hazardous materials / biohazard</li> 
       </ul>
       <p>Drag and drop each item into its correct category by clicking and holding the item, then moving it to the right spot and releasing it.</p> 
       <p>Earn points for each correct sort and try to avoid missing or getting the wrong category. You have three chances.</p>  
       <p>Keep sorting until everything is in placeâ€”good luck!</p>
