Greetings!
Your new task is to sort out some waste as they move through the conveyor belt!
Green bins are for non-biodegradable materials / recycle
Yellow bins are for biodegradable materials / residual
Red bins are for hazardous materials / biohazard
Drag and drop each item into its correct category by clicking and holding the item, then moving it to the right spot and releasing it.
Earn points for each correct sort and try to avoid missing or getting the wrong category. You have three chances.
Keep sorting until everything is in placeâ€”good luck!
